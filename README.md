# Population-Public-Health-Research-Report-and-Presentation

Overview:

This repository contains research on measles informatics, focusing on challenges and solutions in tracking and responding to measles outbreaks. The research explores issues such as delays in reporting, incomplete data, data quality, limited data sharing, resource shortages, privacy concerns, and underreporting of cases. Additionally, it discusses the importance of global coordination in addressing these challenges effectively.

Research Question

The primary research question addressed in this study is: What are the challenges faced in measles informatics, and how can they be mitigated to improve outbreak tracking and response?

Methodology:

The research methodology involved a comprehensive review of existing literature on measles surveillance, informatics, and public health. Data from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and academic journals were analyzed to identify key challenges and potential solutions. Additionally, interviews with public health experts and stakeholders were conducted to gather insights and perspectives on measles informatics.

Findings:

Delays in Reporting: Challenges in timely reporting hinder prompt outbreak tracking.
Incomplete Data: Missing and inaccurate data complicate the understanding of measles outbreaks.
Data Quality Issues: Inaccuracies in reported data further exacerbate surveillance challenges.
Limited Data Sharing: Lack of interoperability and data sharing across systems leads to gaps in outbreak understanding.
Resource Shortages: Insufficient resources hamper effective response efforts.
Privacy Concerns: Data privacy considerations pose challenges in data sharing and collaboration.
Underreporting of Cases: Actual measles cases may be higher due to underreporting.
Global Coordination: International collaboration is essential for addressing measles challenges effectively.

Personal Contributions:

For this project, I partnered with a classmate to research measles and its connection to informatics. Together, we conducted thorough research and analyzed data. This collaborative effort deepened our understanding of measles surveillance and informatics, contributing to our academic growth.

Presentation Materials:

The repository includes presentation slides summarizing the research findings, key insights, and recommendations for addressing measles informatics challenges.

Future Directions:

Future research directions may include exploring innovative technological solutions, improving data sharing protocols, and enhancing global collaboration in measles surveillance and response efforts.
